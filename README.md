# Netlify Starter Headless

Create API's with Netlify Functions.

## What is it?

AWS Serverless functions are awesome, but having to deal with
AWS to get it all setup properly isn't. This starter kit lets
you quickly build full fledged serverless API's using Netlify

## Getting Started

```bash

git clone <repo> ## clone the repository

npm run dev ## Start the dev server

```

Then run `curl http://localhost:8888/api/hello-world`.
should see the result:

```json


```
